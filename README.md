serial.serialutil.SerialException: [Errno 13] could not open port /dev/ttyUSB0: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/dev/ttyUSB0' , just solution on arch

This error typically indicates that the user running the program does not have the necessary permissions to access the serial port '/dev/ttyUSB0'. Here are a few possible solutions to this problem on Arch Linux:

Grant permissions to the user: You can add the user to the 'dialout' group, which typically has access to the serial ports. Open a terminal and run the following command:

sudo groupadd dialout
sudo usermod -aG dialout arch
You may need to log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.

Grant permissions to the port: Alternatively, you can grant read and write permissions to the specific port '/dev/ttyUSB0'. Open a terminal and run the following command:

sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyUSB0

Please note that these solutions might require administrative privileges, so you may need to prefix the commands with sudo. After applying one of these solutions, try running your program again, and it should be able to access the serial port without permission denied errors.

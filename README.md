This error typically indicates that the user running the program does not have the necessary permissions to access the serial port '/dev/ttyUSB0'. Here are a few possible solutions to this problem on Arch Linux:

Grant permissions to the user: You can add the user to the 'dialout' group, which typically has access to the serial ports. Open a terminal and run the following command:



sudo gpasswd --add <username> dialout
Replace <username> with your actual username. You may need to log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.

Grant permissions to the port: Alternatively, you can grant read and write permissions to the specific port '/dev/ttyUSB0'. Open a terminal and run the following command:



sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyUSB0
Specify udev rule: Create a custom udev rule to grant permissions to the port when it is plugged in. Open a terminal and create a new file under the /etc/udev/rules.d/ directory. For example:


sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/99-usb-serial.rules
Add the following line to the file, and save it:


KERNEL=="ttyUSB[0-9]*", MODE="0666"
This rule grants read and write permissions to all users for any USB serial port.

Please note that these solutions might require administrative privileges, so you may need to prefix the commands with sudo. After applying one of these solutions, try running your program again, and it should be able to access the serial port without permission denied errors.
